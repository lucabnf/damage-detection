# Vehicle damage detection with Mask R-CNN
We are asked to create a jupyter notebook to train a segmentation model for damage detection based on the given training data.
The following repository provides an implementation of the Mask R-CNN[Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN), training and evaluating a semantic segmenation model for damage detection on vehicles.

## Approach

## Requirements
The necessary requirements are specified in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/lucabnf/damage-detection/Mask_RCNN/requirements.txt). To run the following program on your own machine: 
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependecies
   `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run setup from the repository root directort
   `python3 setup.py install`
